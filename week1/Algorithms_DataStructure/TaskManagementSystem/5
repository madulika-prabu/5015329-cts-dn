Exercise 5: Task Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing a task management system where tasks need to be added, deleted, and traversed efficiently.
Steps:
1.	Understand Linked Lists:
o	Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Task with attributes like taskId, taskName, and status.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement a singly linked list to manage tasks.
o	Implement methods to add, search, traverse, and delete tasks in the linked list.
4.	Analysis:
o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
o	Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.
