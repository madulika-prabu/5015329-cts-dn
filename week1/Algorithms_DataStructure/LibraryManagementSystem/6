Exercise 6: Library Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing a library management system where users can search for books by title or author.
Steps:
1.	Understand Search Algorithms:
o	Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Book with attributes like bookId, title, and author.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement linear search to find books by title.
o	Implement binary search to find books by title (assuming the list is sorted).
4.	Analysis:
o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
o	Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
